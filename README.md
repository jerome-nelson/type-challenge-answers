## Purpose
To know what I don't know about TypeScript

# Key Takeaways

## Arrays
1. Can access array properties using syntax like so:
    - `T["length"]` - will dynamically return length of literal array type
    - `T[number]` - dynamic reference to array values
2. Extends can be used as a strict equality operator
